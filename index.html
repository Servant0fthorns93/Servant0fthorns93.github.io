	<h1>&nbsp; Product Catalog</h1>
	<p> Hello everyone! Thank you for taking the time to look at this. Below are samples of how I am planning on creating a product catalog for our department. </p>
	<p> The key information for looking for parts, I believe, are Part Number, Type (such as cable, monitor, terminal, etc), and a small description of the part with how it is 
	written on orders and the types of installs that the part is used for. I did not include pictures due to loading time. When you have thousands and thousands of pictures trying to load at once not only will 
	take forever to get everythingn loaded, but also will make the search function take longer and possible cash the page. I have linked the picture to the part number. Click on a part number to see the picture. </p>
	<p> After looking at all of these and play around with the search, please fill out this <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Q2SNTYG" target="blank" title="Feedback Survey">survey</a> for feedback about anything. </p>
	
	<h1>&nbsp; Multiple Tables </h1>
	In a web-based format, the Product Catalog is going to have links for each concept. Instead of creating a master table, breaking the list up by concept will help filtering the list
	and helps on a editing side as well. So, there will be a basic welcome page that describes the purpose of the webpages (helping us look up parts and learning equipment) and how to use it with
	at least 7 seperate links for our concepts. At this time, I don't have an idea for items that are used in all concepts.
		<ul style="margin:0px;">
			<li> McDonalds </li>
			<li> Taco Bell </li>
			<li> KFC </li>
			<li> Pizza Hut </li>
			<li> CKE </li>
			<li> Brink </li>
			<li> Other (Heritage) </li>
		</ul>
	As Brink grows, we can seperate the main link into the individual ones. I would like to keep all links to the lists on the main page to minimize the number of clicks it takes to get you where
	you need to find what you're looking for; so to get to, let's say, a piece for a Five Guys, all you have to click is the Brink list and you and search by "five guys." 
	<br><br>
	Try some of these in your searches!
